Experimenting Entity-Component-System (ECS) and Physics by implementing Arknoid game

Simple implementation of Arknoid game using:
* ***SFML2*** for Window Management, Rendering and Audio
* ***ECS Pattern*** in order to implement game logic and benefict of data alignment in memory
* ***Physics Pattern*** such as ***AABB Collision Detection*** (Static and Sweep Test to avoid tunneling effect) and ***Minkowsky Algorithm***
