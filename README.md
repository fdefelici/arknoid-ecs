# arknoid-ecs
Experimenting Entity-Component-System (ECS) and Physics by implementing Arknoid game

## Objectives
Arknoid game used as a playground to make experiments with:
* ***SFML2*** for Window Management, Rendering and Audio
* ***ECS Pattern*** in order to implement game logic and benefict of data alignment in memory
* ***Physics Pattern*** such as ***AABB Collision Detection*** (Static and Sweep Test to avoid tunneling effect) and ***Minkowsky Algorithm***

## Development Environment
* Visual Studio 2017
* CPP11 compliant
* GoogleTest (GTest) framework for unit testing
* SFML 2.5.1
